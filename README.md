This repository contains [OpenAPI specifications](https://www.openapis.org/) for [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email)'s API. You can find a more detailed API reference on Buttondown's [documentation site](https://docs.buttondown.email/api-reference/introduction).

In addition to the core OpenAPI spec, this repository contains two supplementary files meant to improve the experience of writing against Buttondown's API:

- `fixtures.json`, which contains test fixtures fore resources in the core spec.
- `enums.json`, which contains detailed information about enums declared within the core spec. (This would ideally be subsumed into the spec itself, but [such a thing is not yet possible](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/348).)

Changes to the API can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/buttondown-email/openapi/releases) section.
